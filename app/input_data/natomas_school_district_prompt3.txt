**How to Use This Prompt in Python:**

1.  **Data Preparation:** You would create a Python dictionary (or load from JSON/YAML) where the keys in the dictionary *directly correspond* to the bracketed placeholders `[like this]` in the prompt above. For example:
    ```python
    response_data = {
        "company_name": "Your Awesome After School Programs Inc.",
        "address": "123 Education Lane...",
        "need_for_program_intro": "Our program addresses the critical need for...",
        # ... and so on for every bracketed placeholder
        "q1_answer": "Our agency currently provides programming at [School Name] focusing on [Services Provided]...",
        "q2_answer": "Yes, we previously served as a NUSD LEAP Academy Core Program Provider during [Years]...",
        # ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Templating:** You would then use a templating engine like Jinja2 (which `docxtpl` uses) to fill in a Word document template (`.docx`) with this data. The template would contain Jinja2 tags like `{{ company_name }}` or `{{ q1_answer }}` that correspond to the keys in your `response_data` dictionary.

**Example Jinja2 Snippet for the Template:**

```html
<p><b>Company Name:</b> {{ company_name }}</p>
<p><b>Address:</b> {{ address }}</p>

<h2>Proposal Narrative</h2>
<h3>Need for Program</h3>
<p>{{ need_for_program_intro }}</p>

<h3>Program Design</h3>
<p><b>Alignment:</b> {{ program_design_alignment }}</p>
<p><b>Recruitment & Retention:</b> {{ program_design_recruitment_retention }}</p>

<h2>Application Questions</h2>
{% for question_key, answer in application_questions.items() %} {# Assuming you structure your Q&A in a nested dict #}
    <p><b>{{ question_key }}:</b> {{ answer }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

This prompt is designed to be used either by an AI model to generate the *content*, or by you (or your team) to systematically gather and structure the content that your Python script will then insert into the Word document.
