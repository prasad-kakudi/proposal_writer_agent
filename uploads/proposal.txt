**1. Executive Summary**

Musical Instruments N Kids Hands (M.I.N.K.H.) / Music Science Group is
proud to present a transformative proposal designed to address both
educational inequities and the persistent digital divide affecting
underserved communities in TRUSD. In California's most challenged
neighborhoods, many students lack the digital resources afforded to
their more affluent peers---a gap that limits future opportunities.

Our program harnesses the power of music combined with cutting-edge
technology to deliver high-quality S.T.E.A.M. enrichment, directly
responding to TRUSD's call for equity-driven initiatives. Drawing on our
deep community roots and the visionary legacy of

founder Clarence "Flip" Kirby, we offer students hands-on experiences
with digital arts and music creation, 3D-printed instruments, robotics,
coding, entry-level engineering projects and AI composition. This
integrated approach is proven to:

> • **Close the Opportunity Gap:** Deliver free, hands-on learning to
> underserved youth. • **Cultivate 21st-Century Skills:** Equip students
> with competencies essential for
>
> future tech and creative industries.
>
> • **Foster Social-Emotional Resilience:** Use music as a means for
> personal expression and community building.
>
> • **Improve academic performance:** Students build confidence in their
> ability to learn and introduce them to career exploration

With a track record of 90% student retention and a documented 25%
improvement in math proficiency through our S.T.E.A.M. projects, our
proposal aligns with TRUSD's high standards for safety, equity, and
educational impact.

**2. Firm Experience**

This bold mission started with one man and one big idea. Clarence
"**Flip" Kirby**, a Sacramento native and celebrated professional
musician, built a legacy performing alongside legendary R&B artists like
Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston. But when Flip retired, he chose to give
back to the community that shaped him.

Armed with a dream and a mobile recording studio inside a U-Haul truck,
Flip brought music creation to community centers in underserved
neighborhoods. Kids stepped into the truck to find more than microphones
and mixing boards-they found an outlet for their creativity, a space to
collaborate, and a safe haven from negative influences.

What began as one man's grassroot efforts grew into a movement that's
changing lives across California.

**Expanding the Vision**

Today, **Music Science Group** has evolved far beyond a U-Haul truck.
The organization now delivers immersive after-school programs to three
school districts (Sacramento, Twin Rivers and Folson Cordova) and has
partnered and provided services for the City of Sacramento, The
California Mental Health Services Authority, MOSAC, The Greater
Sacramento Urban League and the 100 Black Men organization. The Music
Science Technology Program ensures that students from marginalized
communities have access to digital devices and skills shaping their
futures. From urban centers to rural schools, MSG is turning the tide by
showing students the exciting possibilities technology can unlock.

Through these programs, kids learn much more than music. They gain:

• **STEAM skills**: A foundation in Science, Technology, Engineering,
Arts, and Math • **Teamwork and collaboration**: The ability to work
effectively with peers

• **Critical thinking and problem-solving**: Tools to navigate complex
challenges • **Mental wellness and coping skills**: Support to manage
emotions and build resilience

• **Confidence and self-belief**: The knowledge that they can achieve
and learn

For kids in underserved communities, MSG isn't just an after-school
program, it's a lifeline. It's a chance to see themselves as creators,
innovators, and leaders. It's the belief that no matter where they come
from, their future is limitless.

Music Science Group is more than a program. It's a movement, a bridge,
and a promise. A promise that every child deserves the tools to dream
big, to create, and to thrive in a tech-driven world.

**3. Staff Recruitment and Management**

> universities majoring in education, computer programming, engineering,
> and former teachers,

> background checks--- including Live Scan fingerprinting and FBI/DOJ

> multilingual support in Spanish and English.
