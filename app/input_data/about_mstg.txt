In California's underserved communities, the digital divide casts a long shadow. While affluent families introduce their children to advanced digital devices and technologies as early as kindergarten, countless others are left behind, unable to afford these critical tools. This divide doesn't just limit access to technology, it limits futures. But one organization is redefining what's possible. Enter Music Science & Technology Group (MSTG), a trailblazing initiative that combines the transformative power of music with cutting-edge technology to deliver opportunity where it's needed most. Turning Challenges into Opportunities

Music Science & Technology Group isn't just closing the digital divide-it's erasing it. Through hands-on programs, MSTG brings advanced technology directly into classrooms, introducing students to tools they might otherwise never encounter: 
* Digital music stations that turn creativity into sound
* 3D printing of instruments that bring design and innovation to life
* Artificial Intelligence tools that make music creation interactive and exciting
* Robotics, coding, and programming that build skills for tomorrow's careers
* Entry-level engineering projects that teach problem-solving and innovation
* Digital arts and media creation to inspire self-expression and storytelling
* Introductory music instruction that sparks joy and confidence
* Introductory dance program that boosts confidence and discover the pure joy of dance

By combining music and technology, MSTG transforms classrooms into hubs of creativity and exploration, proving to students that learning can be exciting, empowering, and fun. The Visionary Behind the Movement This bold mission started with one man and one big idea. Clarence "Flip" Kirby, a Sacramento native and celebrated professional musician, built a legacy performing alongside legendary R&B artists like Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston. But when Flip retired, he chose to give back to the community that shaped him. Armed with a dream and a mobile recording studio inside a U-Haul truck, Flip brought music creation to community centers in underserved neighborhoods. Kids stepped into the truck to find more than microphones and mixing boards-they found an outlet for their creativity, a space to collaborate, and a safe haven from negative influences. What began as one man's grassroot efforts grew into a movement that's changing lives across California.
Expanding the Vision
Today, Music Science & Technology Group has evolved far beyond a U-Haul truck. The organization now delivers immersive after-school programs to three school districts (Sacramento, Twin Rivers and Folson Cordova) and has partnered and provided services for the City of Sacramento, The California Mental Health Services Authority, MOSAC, The Greater Sacramento Urban League and the 100 Black Men organization. The Music Science Technology Program ensures that students from marginalized communities have access to digital devices and skills shaping their futures. From urban centers to rural schools, MSTG is turning the tide by showing students the exciting possibilities technology can unlock. Through these programs, kids learn much more than music. Th
